Compilation and execution
-------------------------

The following commands work inside the directory project
(i.e. make sure you're in the right directory before typing them in!)

- To compile & run the executable, type: make run
- To clean the directory, type:          make clean

- If you wish only to compile the project, type: make
  (the executable file's name is "L5R")

Project Goal
------------

In this project we've tried to simulate the trading cards game
"Legend of the Five Rings". The project's description can be
found in the file "OOPproj_2020.pdf".
